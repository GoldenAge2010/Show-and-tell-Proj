# Neural Image Captioning â€“ GRU based Sentence Generator 

Developed Tensorflow implementation of attention based approach on benchmark datasets using the BLEU metric

Applied learned attention combined with the modularity of the encode-decode approach to give more interpretability into the models generation process

Refined the image model (inception V3) while training the LSTM, the GRU, and a deeper LSTM

Ensembled different models and demonstrated the fine tuning correspond very well to human intuition
